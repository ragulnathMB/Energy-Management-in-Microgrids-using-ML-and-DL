# 🌍🔋 Energy Management in Microgrids using ML & DL

## 🚀 Overview
Microgrids integrate **renewable energy sources**, **energy storage systems**, and **dynamic loads**, making energy management complex. Efficiently managing energy within microgrids is crucial for:
- Maximizing **renewable energy utilization**
- Reducing **operational costs**
- Improving **energy efficiency**

Traditional methods struggle with challenges like **load forecasting**, **renewable energy variability**, and **real-time optimization**. Our solution leverages **XG Boost (ML) and Deep Neural Network (DL)** to address these issues effectively. 🧠⚡ [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaSsGjpDEFM&t=14s)
